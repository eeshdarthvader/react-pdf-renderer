A React component to view a PDF document.
It's written in TypeScript, and powered by React hooks completely.




## Commands

1. Build:

~~~ console
$ npm run build
~~~

Then it will produce two formats available in the `dist` folder:

~~~
└─── dist
    ├─── cjs    // CommonJS package
    └─── umd    // UMD package
~~~

2. Dev mode:

~~~ console
$ npm run dev
~~~

The bundler will watch the entire `src` folder and build the `cjs` package when any source file is changed.

3. Lint:

~~~ console
$ npm run lint
